This is my first desktop application
Here is an feauturistic Online electrical billing system
  Here the Customers in our portal after registering are provided with wide variety of feautures
       Here are some innovative ideas implemented
             Customers can
                1.Raise any issues if there are any which can be viewed and addresed by the admin
                2.They will have a notification box which they can view
                3.They can view their monthly usage on a 2D graph.
                4.They have provision to pay(though real payement is not integrated)
        Similarly
              Admins also have maintain a prominent control in the portal here are some powers he has acces to
                1.He can block a customers account if the payements are not cleared before the deadline
                2.He can promote any product by sending a notification to all customers
                3.He can also send a notification to a specific customer regarding his bill payement
                4.He can delete a customers account.
        A blocked customer can still acces the portal but he will be only having a payement option overthere which he has to do if he wants resume the services.
        and many more conventional features
               At the signup 
                    Like a new admin's account will be in active status only when an existing admin approves him.
                    and the admins and customers can view their profiles and generate the bill and so..on.
                    
 Thanks for reading.
